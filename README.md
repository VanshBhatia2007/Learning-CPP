# 🧠 C++ Learning Journey

Welcome! I'm **Vansh Bhatia**, and this repository is my personal log of learning **C++** from the **Coding Blocks** DSA course. I'm documenting my journey with flowcharts, code, and daily progress — one concept at a time.

## 👤 About Me

Hi! I'm passionate about coding and problem-solving. I've started this journey with **C++** to master **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** and build a strong foundation in programming.

This repo keeps me accountable and helps me track my daily progress while learning from Coding Blocks.

---

## 🎯 Goal

- ✅ Learn core C++ syntax and concepts
- ✅ Build strong problem-solving skills through DSA
- ✅ Practice daily and stay consistent
- ✅ Document everything with code and notes
